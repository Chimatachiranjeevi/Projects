# Automatic Diamond Cutting Machine

## description : 
   - **in this project the machine will cut the diamond
       in very precise micron level,with the help of quadrature
       encoder servo motors for movement,laser sensor,proxy
       sensor,CV CAMERAS(feed back mechanism)**

### MY TASK :
 1) **In this project i have to assign GPIO for servo
motors(rpm,angle),stepper motors,sensors) and writing the
logic for which angle the servo should be start and stop by
taking the feedback mechanism of encoders and sensors for
cutting the perfect shape of diamond**
2) **controlling and
communication the machine through communication
protocols(UART,SPI,I2C), with the help of commands**
3) **worked on EEPROM(I2C)**
## accomplishments : 
- ADC,TIMERS, INTERRUPT
  CONCEPTS AND applied in the project
